This repo holds analyses used in the manuscript, "InSituCor: a toolkit for discovering non-trivial spatial correlations in spatial transcriptomics".

Note: the datasets used here are too big to host on github. They can be downloaded from Figshare at: [https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CosMx_6000-plex_colon_cancer_dataset/24164388](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CosMx_6000-plex_colon_cancer_dataset/24164388).

How to use:
- First, download the data from the above url and place in the "data" folder. 
- Each folder holds a distinct analysis (a figure or sub-figure)
- All R scripts execute in the directory in which they lie
